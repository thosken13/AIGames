Features:
-rewrite/sort playAndTrain runEpisodes etc. functions so that work is split sensibly
-for validation step do mutiple episodes and take average score to put in tb
-dropout (low) and batch normalization

Test different models:
-try stepping learning rate?
-try different losses
-Run over a number of model parameters (layers, nodes, learning rate, ...)
-run over a number of rl parameters (gamma, epsilon schedule, ...)

In new agent
-target network?
-curiosity based exploration
-try a model based version of rl
